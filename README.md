3. Add your custom domain
4. Update your DNS records as instructed

## Accessing PocketBase

Once deployed, you can access:

- **Admin UI**: `https://your-app-url.ondigitalocean.app/_/`
- **API**: `https://your-app-url.ondigitalocean.app/api/`
- **Health Check**: `https://your-app-url.ondigitalocean.app/api/health`

### Initial Setup

1. Create your admin account via the App Platform Console (see "Create Your Admin Account" section above)
2. Navigate to the Admin UI at `/_/`
3. Start creating collections and configuring your backend

## Storage Considerations

### Testing/Development (Current Setup)

- **Storage**: Ephemeral SQLite database
- **Location**: `/app/pb_data/data.db`
- **Limit**: 2GiB total ephemeral storage
- **Warning**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **Data is lost on each deployment**

This setup is ideal for:
- Testing and experimentation
- Development environments
- Demos and proof-of-concepts

### Production (Recommended)

For production use with persistent data, you have two options:

#### Option 1: Use Litestream for SQLite Backup (Available Now)

**Litestream** provides continuous replication of your SQLite database to DigitalOcean Spaces. This template includes built-in Litestream support:

- **Automatic backups**: Continuously replicates your database to object storage
- **Disaster recovery**: Automatically restores from backup on container restart
- **Easy setup**: Just configure environment variables (see Production Setup section below)

**Note**: PocketBase only supports SQLite databases. It does not support PostgreSQL or other database engines.

#### Option 2: Wait for NFS Support (Q1 2026)

DigitalOcean App Platform will support persistent volumes via NFS in Q1 2026. Once available, you can mount persistent storage for the SQLite database directly.

See `PRODUCTION.md` for detailed Litestream setup and production hardening steps.

## Production Setup: Litestream Backup

### What is Litestream?

[Litestream](https://litestream.io) is a streaming replication tool for SQLite databases. It continuously backs up your database to object storage (DigitalOcean Spaces) and can automatically restore it on container restart.

### Why Use Litestream?

- **Automatic Backups**: Continuous replication to DigitalOcean Spaces
- **Disaster Recovery**: Auto-restore database when container restarts
- **Cost-Effective**: ~$5/month for Spaces vs $15/month for managed database
- **Zero Downtime**: Replication happens in the background
- **SQLite Performance**: Keep using fast local SQLite with cloud backup

### Quick Setup

**Step 1: Create a DigitalOcean Space**

1. Go to [DigitalOcean Spaces](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/spaces)
2. Click **Create a Space**
3. Choose a region (e.g., `nyc3`)
4. Name your space (e.g., `my-pocketbase-backups`)
5. Click **Create a Space**

**Step 2: Generate API Keys**

1. Go to [API Tokens](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/tokens)
2. Scroll to **Spaces access keys**
3. Click **Generate New Key**
4. Name it (e.g., `pocketbase-litestream`)
5. Save the **Access Key** and **Secret Key** (you'll need these)

**Step 3: Configure Environment Variables**

In your App Platform dashboard:

1. Go to your PocketBase app
2. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **App-Level Environment Variables**
3. Add these three variables:

   | Key | Value | Type |
   |-----|-------|------|
   | `LITESTREAM_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Your Spaces access key | Secret |
   | `LITESTREAM_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Your Spaces secret key | Secret |
   | `REPLICA_URL` | `s3://YOUR-SPACE-NAME.REGION.digitaloceanspaces.com/pocketbase-db` | Regular |

   Replace:
   - `YOUR-SPACE-NAME` with your actual space name
   - `REGION` with your space region (e.g., `nyc3`)

4. Click **Save** and redeploy your app

**That's it!** Your database is now being backed up continuously to DigitalOcean Spaces.

### Verifying Backups

Check your app logs to confirm Litestream is working:

```bash
doctl apps logs YOUR_APP_ID --type run
```

You should see:
```
‚úì Litestream environment variables detected
Starting PocketBase with Litestream replication...
```

You can also check your Space in the DO dashboard - you should see backup files appearing.

### Restoring from Backup

Litestream automatically restores your database when the container starts. If your database is lost (e.g., after redeployment), Litestream will:

1. Detect the missing database
2. Restore it from the latest backup in Spaces
3. Start PocketBase with your data intact

No manual intervention required!

### Cost

- **Spaces Storage**: $5/month for 250 GB + 1 TB transfer
- **Typical Usage**: < 1 GB for most PocketBase databases
- **Total**: ~$5/month for production-grade backups

### Troubleshooting

**Backups not working?**

1. Check environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify your Spaces access key has write permissions
3. Check logs for Litestream errors: `doctl apps logs YOUR_APP_ID --type run`

**Database not restoring?**

1. Ensure `REPLICA_URL` matches your Space name and region
2. Check that backup files exist in your Space
3. Look for restoration logs on container startup

For more details, see `PRODUCTION.md` and the [Litestream documentation](https://litestream.io/guides/digitalocean/).

## Scaling

### Vertical Scaling
Upgrade to larger instance sizes:
- `apps-s-2vcpu-4gb` - 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM - $24/month
- `apps-s-4vcpu-8gb` - 4 vCPU, 8GB RAM - $48/month

### Horizontal Scaling
For dedicated CPU instances, enable autoscaling:
```yaml
instance_count: 1
autoscaling:
  min_instance_count: 1
  max_instance_count: 5
  metrics:
    cpu:
      percent: 80
```

## Monitoring

App Platform provides built-in monitoring:
- **Metrics**: CPU, memory, request rate in the "Insights" tab
- **Logs**: Real-time logs in the "Logs" tab
- **Alerts**: Configure alerts in the "Settings" tab

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

Check the build logs in the App Platform console. Common issues:
- Go version mismatch (requires Go 1.23+)
- Build timeout (increase in app spec if needed)

### App Won't Start

Check the runtime logs:
- Verify the port is set to 8080
- Ensure health check endpoint is accessible
- Check environment variables are set correctly

### Database Issues

PocketBase uses SQLite:
- Remember data is ephemeral without Litestream backups
- Check you're not exceeding 2GiB local storage
- If using Litestream, verify environment variables are set correctly
- Check Litestream logs for replication errors

### Performance Issues

- Monitor CPU/memory usage in Insights
- Consider upgrading instance size
- Check Litestream replication is not causing bottlenecks

## Cost Estimate

### Minimal Setup (SQLite without backups)
- **Service**: $12/month (apps-s-1vcpu-1gb)
- **Total**: ~$12/month

### Production Setup (SQLite + Litestream)
- **Service**: $12/month (apps-s-1vcpu-1gb)
- **DigitalOcean Spaces**: $5/month (250 GB storage + 1 TB transfer)
- **Total**: ~$17/month

## Limitations

- **Ephemeral Storage**: Only 2GiB, wiped on each deployment
- **No Persistent Volumes**: Until Q1 2026 NFS support
- **No SSH Access**: App Platform is a managed PaaS
- **Build Timeout**: 1 hour maximum
- **Region**: Must choose from available App Platform regions
